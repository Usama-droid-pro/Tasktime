## Introduction

This feature enables employees to log their daily work tasks and allows managers/employees to view logged time entries by employee. The system should support multiple task entries per day, proper validation, and comprehensive viewing capabilities with filtering options.

## Glossary

- **TimeLog_System**: The timesheet logging and viewing application
- **Employee**: A user who logs time entries for their work
- **Manager**: A user who can view time logs for all employees
- **Task_Entry**: A single work item logged by an employee with project, description, and hours
- **Daily_Log**: A collection of task entries for a specific date with total hours
- **Time_Validation**: Process of ensuring total hours match sum of individual task hours
